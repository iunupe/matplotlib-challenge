Observations:
1. For the Capomulin Regimen, a strong positive correlation exists.
2. For mouse x401 (exposed to the Capomullin regimen), tumor volume decreased by half over time.
3. The Infubinol and Ceftamin regimens yielded the highest tumor volumes of the top 4, which suggests these drugs are not as effective as Capomulin and Ramicane.
